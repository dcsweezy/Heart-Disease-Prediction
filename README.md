# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Risk Prediction Model

A data-driven project conducted under the NTU-EEE module *"Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence"* (Aug 2022 ‚Äì Nov 2022), aimed at predicting the likelihood of contracting heart disease based on behavioral, medical, and socioeconomic factors. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning for public health risk modeling and insights generation.

## üß† Project Summary

- Led a 3-member team to explore correlations between health outcomes and individual variables such as **age**, **BMI**, **income**, **mental health**, and **smoking habits**.
- Built classification models using **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **Decision Trees** in Python to predict heart disease risk.
- Performed extensive **feature engineering**, **correlation analysis**, and **model tuning** to identify key predictors and improve model performance.
- Achieved:
  - **77% accuracy** using Decision Trees
  - ~**80% true positive rate** using Logistic Regression
- Delivered actionable insights on health risk factors and demonstrated trade-offs between model **precision**, **recall**, and **interpretability**.
